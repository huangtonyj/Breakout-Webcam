## How does it work?
## Feature Challenges/Highlights

Given a week time to complete this project, implementing some sort of machine learning was defintely a stretch. The very first set of MVPs were to build a product playable with the keyboard inputs. There were minor bugs and hiccups along the way like ball gained too much speed and skipped frames thus avoided some collision detection logic.

After the game was playable with keyboard inputs, the next step was to incorporate webcam controls. This was no easy feat but I have to thank the [Google TensorFlow.js](https://js.tensorflow.org/) team for wonderful examples to wrok from.

### Incorporating TensorFlow

0. Build functional game with keyboard controls
1. Training a model
2. Incorporating predictions
3. model accuracy and black box


```javascript
  <div className='post-index-item'>
  </div>
);
```

## Features in the Pipeline:

* Improve model predicion accuracy
* Webcam compabilility with Safari browser
